    "- The expression you provided involves the Dirac delta function (δ(x − a)) and a function g(x). The Dirac delta function is a mathematical construct that behaves like an \"infinitely narrow\" pulse at the point x = a and is defined by its integral properties:\n",
    "1. ∫ δ(x) dx = 1 (integral over the entire real line)\n",
    "2. ∫ f(x) δ(x - a) dx = f(a) (evaluation property)\n",

    "The expression you provided, g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a)δ(x − a), is valid in the context of the evaluation property of the Dirac delta function. It states that if you multiply a function g(x) by the Dirac delta function δ(x − a), the result is equivalent to evaluating the function g(x) at the point x = a and then multiplying the result by the Dirac delta function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "1. Start with g(x)δ(x − a)\n",
    "2. Apply the evaluation property of the Dirac delta function:\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = g(a) (integrate over all x)\n",
    "3. Multiply both sides by δ(x − a) to get:\n",
    "g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a)δ(x − a)\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is useful in certain mathematical and physical applications, where it allows us to simplify expressions involving the Dirac delta function. Keep in mind that the Dirac delta function is not a traditional function but a distribution, and its manipulation requires caution and adherence to the rules of distribution theory.\n",

    "Starting with the result from step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = g(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a)δ(x − a)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll use the following property of the Dirac delta function:\n",
    "\n",
    "If ∫ f(x) δ(x - a) dx = f(a), then δ(x - a) = 0 for all x ≠ a.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the Dirac delta function is zero everywhere except at x = a, where it behaves like an infinitely narrow pulse. Now, let's use this property to show that g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a)δ(x − a):\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = g(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Dirac delta function is zero everywhere except at x = a, we can split the integral into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = ∫ g(a)δ(x − a) dx\n",
    "\n",
    "The right-hand side can be simplified further because the integral of the Dirac delta function with respect to x is equal to 1 when x is in the domain of the pulse (x = a) and 0 otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(a)δ(x − a) dx = g(a) ∫ δ(x − a) dx\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we know from the definition of the Dirac delta function that ∫ δ(x) dx = 1 (integral over the entire real line). Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(a)δ(x − a) dx = g(a) * 1\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "g(a) * 1 = g(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's go back to the original equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = g(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have shown that g(a) * 1 = g(a), we can replace the right-hand side of the equation with g(a):\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ g(x)δ(x − a) dx = g(a) * 1\n",
    "\n",
    "g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a) * 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we arrive at the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "g(x)δ(x − a) = g(a)δ(x − a)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the original expression g(x)δ(x − a) is equal to g(a)δ(x − a)."
